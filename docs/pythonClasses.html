<h1>Python Classes</h1>
Classes are created in python to avoid programmer confusion.<br>
The goal is to create an application based on simple parts(classes)<br>
Each class is as totally self-contained as possible and grouped based on functionality<br>
The piPair application is based on the classes: 
<table border='2px solid'>
<tr><td>utilityScreens.py</td><td>Show a basic screen with a caption and an Ok button</td></tr>
<tr><td>inputOutput.py</td><td>Communicate with player and opponent</td></tr>
<tr><td>cardDatabase.py</td><td>Information that defines individual Magic the Gathering cards</td></tr>
<tr><td>cardDeck.py</td><td>Class that handles MTG deck actions</td></tr>
<tr><td>mthScreens.py</td></td>Classes for showing Magic the Gathering pages</td></tr>
</table>
